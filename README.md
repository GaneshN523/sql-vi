🛠️ SQL Visualizer
Overview
SQL Visualizer is an interactive learning tool designed to help learners understand SQL concepts through a graphical UI. Instead of manually writing SQL queries, users can perform database operations visually, and the tool will automatically generate the corresponding SQL queries.

This project is perfect for beginners who want to learn SQL intuitively and for advanced users who wish to visualize query execution.

🌟 Features
✔️ Graphical Query Builder – Drag-and-drop elements to construct SQL queries.
✔️ Real-Time Query Generation – Automatically converts UI operations into SQL queries.
✔️ SQL Execution & Results Display – Execute queries and see instant database changes.
✔️ Table Relationship Visualization – Interactive ER diagrams to understand table relations.
✔️ Query Optimization Insights – Provides hints on improving query performance.
✔️ Beginner-Friendly Interface – No need for prior SQL knowledge.

📌 Tech Stack
Frontend
React.js (Vite.js) – Fast UI rendering
D3.js / Chart.js – For visualizing table relationships
Tailwind CSS – Responsive UI
Backend
FastAPI / Node.js (Express) – Handles query processing
PostgreSQL / MySQL – Database support for executing queries
🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sql-visualizer.git
cd sql-visualizer
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
3️⃣ Start the Development Server
bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
This will start the app on http://localhost:5173/ (default Vite port).

4️⃣ (Optional) Start the Backend
If the project includes a backend for database interactions:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt  # (For FastAPI)
uvicorn main:app --reload  # (Runs the API)
